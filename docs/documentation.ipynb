    "Our goal in this project is to develop a software library for Automatic Differentiation. We will create a useful tool, familiarize ourselves with software development best-practices, and learn how machines perform differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final deliverable will be an automatic differentiation library in python that is easy to understand, install, and use -- including clear documentation and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the baseline expectation, we intend to extend our project in a specific way: allow for the ingestion of screenshots. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Extended Functionality:** The basic automatic differentiation would accept values or vectors to represent the functional inputs. Beyond the basic functionality, our library will include two key feature extensions. The first is (1) string parsing. The user of the library in terminal will be able to input a function as a text-entry into the command line. Of course, the functionality still exists for users to access the underlying `AD` library directly. And secondly (2), we are extending the functionality to include both forward-mode as well as reverse-mode automatic differentiation accumulation (explained below). "

    "Automatic differentiation is how computers can automatically evaluate derivatives, which comes up in a lot of contexts. The two most obvious approaches to differentiation are symbolic differentiation (applying the rules of variable-level differentiation in software) and numerical differentiation (a finite difference-based approximation of a derivative). \n",
    "\n",
    "The failure of symbolic differentiation is that it can be inefficient in solving high-complexity expressions, yielding long computation times. By contrast, the failure of numerical differentiation is that it can be prone to floating-point error in discretization or suffer from numerical instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Chain Rule\n",
    "In contrast, automatic differentiation applies the chain rule repeatedly to break down arbitrarily complicated differentiation problems into a series of elementary arithmetic operations and elementary functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a way, a derivative is a local linear approximation of a function. By applying the chain rule, we can break down any derivative solving problem, even with high complexity or a partial derivative with respect to many inputs (e.g. gradient-based optimization) into a sequential composition of functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Structure of Calculations\n",
    "While there are many different ways to conceptualize the process used in automatic differentiation, the one explored in our class involves a graphical representation of the calculation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first step, we break down the function into an “evaluation trade,” with a set of xi traces (or intermediary computed variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, you can visualize the calculation steps in an “evaluation graph” - simply a graphical representation of the computation elements with edges and notes (similar to a control loop diagram). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Elementary Functions\n",
    "Finally, through each step you evaluate both the trace in terms of the input variable and also compute the derivative using the chain rule. At the end of this process, the final xi trace now is assigned both a value and a derivative that is simply composed of elemental function that are easy for a computer to evaluate. \n",
    "\n",
    "To give some concrete examples, the key elementary arithmetic operations include: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc... and the key elementary functions include: exp, log, sin, cos, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Automatic Differentiation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an example function:\n",
    "\n",
    "![function](function.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the partial derivative with respect to x2 is already pretty hairy: \n",
    "\n",
    "![partial.png](partial.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the gradient or derivative at any arbitrary value, numerical methods would be plagued with truncation and round-off errors. While the symbolic method is algebraically challenging and computationally expensive. \n",
    "\n",
    "With Automatic differentiation we can build a computational graph to compartmentalize the function into elementary sequential steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "![graph.png](graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "_Computational Graph for Function in the Forward Mode_\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the value and derivative at each node, we walk though the graph and compose the evaluation traces:\n",
    "\n",
    "![forward.png](forward.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the forward trace mode, each term can be calculated from operands that have already been calculated in a higher term. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reverse mode is a similar technique, sometimes referred to as backpropagation, but instead the trace on the right is evaluated from bottom to top:\n",
    "\n",
    "![reverse.png](reverse.png)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using The Command-Line Interface (String-Parser)\n",
    "\n",
    "Users interact with our module via a command-line interface. To start the interface, run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m keydifferentiator\n",
    "```\n",
    "The command line will prompt the user to enter a function. The tool only accepts single-variable functions. Here are some examples:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input your function:   f(x) = 3*x + 4\n",
    "Input your function:   f(x) = cos(x) + x**2\n",
    "Input your function:   f(x) = 3*x + 4\n",
    "Input your function:   f(x) = 3*x**2 + 2*x + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once the user enters a function, the user is prompted to enter a value of x at which to evaluate the derivative. Here is an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "What value of x would you like to evaluate at? Enter a number: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "The interface then prints out the values of the function f(x) and the derivative f'(x) at that value of x:\n",
    "```\n",
    "f(x)=34.00, f'(x)=20.00\n",
